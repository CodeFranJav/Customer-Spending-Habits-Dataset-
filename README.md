# Customer-Spending-Habits-Dataset-
Customer data analysis through data transformation, enrichment, and exploratory data techniques to derive actionable business insights for targeted marketing and strategic planning.

### Summary
This project details the process of optimizing customer data for analysis, focusing on data transformation, enrichment, and exploratory data analysis. By converting raw data into a structured format and integrating additional information from external sources, the dataset was enhanced to provide a more comprehensive understanding of customer demographics, income, and spending habits. The data was further analyzed using Python libraries, with visualizations created to reveal patterns and trends. These steps laid the groundwork for informed decision-making, both in the short term, through sales forecasting and resource allocation, and in the long term, by analyzing market trends and strategic forecasting.

The enriched and transformed data provided several valuable insights. For example, geographic enrichment by adding zip codes and city data allowed for a deeper analysis of customer behavior based on location. This revealed that certain zip codes with higher incomes had lower spending scores, offering opportunities for targeted marketing and strategic planning. Additionally, data visualizations uncovered gaps in spending scores among middle-income earners, highlighting potential areas for further investigation. These insights enable businesses to tailor their marketing strategies, optimize resource allocation, and enhance customer engagement, ultimately driving growth and maintaining a competitive edge.
